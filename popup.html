      <h1>Dukey - Duolingo keyboard focus helper</h1>
      <p>
        This extension makes Duolingo more usable with keyboard, by injecting
        CSS styles that make keyboard focus on buttons and options clearly
        visible when you use Tab key to go forward and Shift + Tab to go
        backward through interactive elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should activate automatically whenever you reload the Duolingo tab or
        switch to it from another tab. But in case it doesn't happen, click the
        button below.
      </p>
      <button id="dukey-button">
        <img src="dukey48.png" alt="Dukey" />
        <br />Manually activate Dukey
      </button>
      <p>
        You'll recognize that it's on when you see a bluish border around
        buttons when you browse through them with Tab (forward) or Shift Tab
        (backward)
      </p>

      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        Making users able to navigate any website using Tab key is an
        accessibility requirement that everyone should take seriously. In most
        cases, all it takes to meet this requirement is NOT to interfere with
        keyboard navigation or hide tab focus styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        But many websites deliberately do it, because keyboard focus styles
        don't look fancy enough. Unfortunately, in 2024 Duolingo is one of such
        websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you try tabbing through buttons and options in any lesson, you simply
        won't see where your focus is. You can press Enter to submit the
        question, and if you start typing some of offered words from Word bank,
        you will have initial letters colored in blue, which is a nice feature
        and I further emphasized it by improving the contrast of these letters.
      </p>
      <img
        src="dukey-explanation-hints.jpg"
        alt="Screenshot of Dukey plugin letter hints in action"
      />
      <p>
        But, the main thing is that you should see where you go with the Tab
        key. That's a darn STANDARD, mostly because of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People with motoric impairments</li>
        <li>People with visual impairments</li>
        <li>People whose mouse got broken or its battery is empty</li>
        <li>People who simply prefer keyboard over mouse</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, not complying to this standard SUCKS. It especially sucks in case of
        Duolingo, since they otherwise do their social mission quite well when
        it comes to promoting gender and racial equality. So, all they need to
        do is to do the same with accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I sincerely hope that Duolingo will take steps to fix their
        keyboard navigation out of the box, even if that will make my efforts in
        making this extension obsolete.
      </p>
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Be careful when using the extension if you aren't used to tab keys.
        Especially keep your hand away from Enter key, because you might submit
        the wrong answer and lose hearts ❤️❤️❤️ just when you need them 😱
      </p>
      <p>
        Also mind that if Duolingo changes CSS selectors in any future redesign,
        some functionalities of Dukey plugin might just stop working.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I hope they'll make it easier for everyone and enable keyboard
        navigation out of the box, which essentially only means to STOP
        DISABLING IT.
      </p>
      <p>Cheers everyone and long live all the languages!</p>

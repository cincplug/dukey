      <h2>Dukey - Duolingo keyboard focus helper</h2>
      <p>
        This extension makes Duolingo more usable with keyboard, by injecting
        CSS styles that make keyboard focus on buttons and options clearly
        visible when you use Tab key to go forward and Shift + Tab to go
        backward through interactive elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should activate the functionality whenever you reload the Duolingo
        tab or switch to it from another tab. But in case it doesn't load
        automatically, you can click the button below.
      </p>
      <button id="dukey-button">
        <img src="dukey48.png" alt="Dukey" />
        <br />Dukey
      </button>
      <p>
        You'll recognize that it's on when you see a bluish border around
        buttons when you browse through them with Tab (forward) or Shift Tab
        (backward)
      </p>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        Making users able to navigate any website using Tab key is an
        accessibility requirement that everyone should take seriously. In most
        cases, all it takes to meet this requirement is NOT to interfere with
        keyboard navigation or hide tab focus styles. But many websites
        deliberately do it, because keyboard focus styles don't look fancy
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Duolingo is one of such websites (at the the moment of
        publishing this extension 14.5.2024). If you try tabbing through buttons
        and options in any lesson, you simply won't see where your focus is. You
        can press Enter to submit the question, and if you start typing some of
        offered words from Word bank, you will have initial letters colored in
        blue, which is a nice feature, but you can't see where you go with the
        Tab key, which is a STANDARD, primarily because of people with motoric
        impairments, and additionally there are many of us who simply prefer
        keyboard over mouse or track pad.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, not complying to this standard is a big pity, especially for the
        website which claims to strive for social values like Duolingo, and it's
        especially a pity since they do this social mission quite well when it
        comes to promoting gender and racial equality and inclusion. So, just
        spread that to accessibility and we're good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I sincerely hope that Duolingo will take steps to fix their
        keyboard navigation out of the box, even if that will make my efforts in
        making this extension obsolete. I initially made it just for personal
        use anyway, and then I thought I'd rather make it visible and help both
        myself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be careful when using the extension and especially keep your hand away
        from Enter key, because you'll submit the wrong answer and lose hearts
        ❤️❤️❤️ just when you need them 😱
      </p>
      <p>So there I warned you!</p>
      <p>
        And in general, it doesn't work perfectly in all cases, plus there's a
        chance that Duolingo might change CSS selectors in scope of some future
        redesign, and then some functionality of Dukey might just stop working.
        But I hope they'll make it easier for everyone and enable keyboard
        navigation themselves.
      </p>
      <p>Cheers everyone and long live all the languages!</p>
